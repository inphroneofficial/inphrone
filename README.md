# 🎬 Inphrone — People-Powered Intelligence for Entertainment

✨ **AI predicts yesterday. Inphrone builds tomorrow.**  
Inphrone is a next-generation platform that transforms audience voices into practical wisdom (Phronesis) for creators, producers, and studios.  

Unlike review platforms (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes) that only capture feedback *after release*, Inphrone provides **real-time pre-creation insights** — enabling smarter, bolder, and audience-driven content decisions.
